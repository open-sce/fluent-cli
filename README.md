# Domino Settings

To connect to Domino you will need at least the URL of where your Domino installation is and a personal API key to
access the API. You can set your variables either as environment variables `DOMINO_API_KEY` and `DOMINO_API_URL` or use
the command line parameters `-k` and `-u`.

### Linux

To add environment variables in Linux so that they are always available upon login, you can modify the shell configuration file for your user. The specific file you need to edit may vary depending on the shell you are using (e.g., Bash, Zsh). Here are the general steps to add environment variables:

1. Identify the shell you are using: Open a terminal and type `echo $SHELL`. This will display the path to the current shell binary.

2. Open the shell configuration file: Use a text editor to open the configuration file for your shell. Here are some common configuration files for popular shells:
   - Bash: `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`
   - Zsh: `~/.zshrc` or `~/.zprofile`
   - Fish: `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

3. Add environment variable assignments: Open the shell configuration file in a text editor and add the following lines at the end:

```shell
export DOMINO_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export DOMINO_API_URL="your_api_url"
```

Replace `"your_api_key"` and `"your_api_url"` with the actual values you want to assign to the environment variables.

4. Save and close the file.

5. Apply the changes: To make the environment variables available in your current terminal session, run the following command in the terminal:

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

Replace `~/.bashrc` with the actual path to your shell configuration file if you are using a different file.

Now, the environment variables `DOMINO_API_KEY` and `DOMINO_API_URL` will be set every time you log in to your Linux system or open a new terminal session.

### Windows

To add your environment variables in Windows Powershell you can add them like this:

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DOMINO_API_KEY", "your_api_key", "User")
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("DOMINO_API_URL", "your_api_url", "User")
```
Replace `"your_api_key"` and `"your_api_url"` with the actual values you want to assign to the environment variables.

# Test
To test the CLI is working, run the following command to print out your current user information:

```shell
$ java -jar ./target/domino-cli.jar user current
```

If you are not using environment variables it would be:

```shell
$ java -jar ./target/domino-cli.jar -k YOUR_KEY -u https://domino.yourcompany.com/v4 user current
```

**Output:**
```json
{
  "firstName": "Homer",
  "lastName": "Simpson",
  "fullName": "Homer Simpson",
  "id": "6124ffbfa7db86282dde302a",
  "userName": "hs12345",
  "email": "homer.simpson@springfield.org"
}
```
